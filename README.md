# Gradcafe Timeline

Inspired by [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/7srxxy/decision_timelines_for_particular_universities/) reddit post on admission timelines for different universities, I decided to go ahead and make a **command line tool for plotting admission decision timeline based on Gradcafe data**.

## Features

- **Gradcafe result timeline plotter** based on admission-related search query
- **Customizable timeline options** (e.g. admission cycle, period, decision type)
- **CLI (Command Line Interface)**, the only interface I understand, kind of

## Getting Started

Please make sure you have all required software/packages installed:

### Prerequisites

- [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [BeautifulSoup4](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/)  `pip install beautifulsoup4`
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/users/installing.html)  `python -m pip install -U matplotlib`

**This CLI tool is best for people who are familiar with basic regex (regular expression) and Gradcafe already.** Please take a look at [Graduate School Admission Results](https://www.thegradcafe.com/survey/) on Gradcafe to see some examples of admission decisions and search queries using regex. If you are unfamiliar with regex, [here](https://medium.com/factory-mind/regex-tutorial-a-simple-cheatsheet-by-examples-649dc1c3f285) is some basic tutorial to get you started.

## Example Usage

After you have installed all dependencies, navigate to the root directory and start with the following simple command in terminal:

``
$ python main.py <query_string>
``

The query string would be the admission-related search in regex you would otherwise enter to search on the [Results](https://www.thegradcafe.com/survey/) page of Gradcafe. **Please make sure to wrap your search string in quotes if it contains any whitespace.**

For example, if you would like to see the admission timeline for "computer science", use

``
$ python main.py "computer science"
``

This would give you a graph generated from **all** decision results (**Interview, Accepted, Rejected & Waitlisted**) available on Gradcafe related to "computer science" over all available years. The time line starts in September and ends in August, basically following a typical academic year in US. For an arbitrary point (x,y) on the graph, x is the date (month and day only), and y is the total number of decisions made by that date. The graph looks like the following:

**_A generic query like "computer science" is likely gonna take a while (i.e. a couple of minutes) to produce any result due to sheer amount of data. Please be patient, or use more specific queries and/or [optional timeline variables](#optional-timeline-variables) if you would like faster response._**

As another example, if you would like to see the admission timeline for "(yale|"johns hopkins") econ*", use

``
$ python main.py "(yale|\"johns hopkins\") econ*"
``

*Note the backslash("\\") in front of quotes as part of the query string. It is required as an escape character for correct python string parsing.*

### Optional Timeline Variables

The following optional arguments allow you to further narrow down admission results by specifying the admission cycles, admission periods, and decision types to be included in your timeline.

| Variable | Option | Description |
|--|--|--|
| help | `--help`, `-h` | help message about general usage of the cli tool |
| minYear | `--min_year`, `-y` | earliest year from which decision results are included **(default: 2012)** |
| startMonth | `--start_month`, `-s` | start month of timeline (academic year) in integer **(default: 9 (September))** | 
| endMonth | `--end_month`, `-e` | end month of timeline (academic year) in integer **(default: 8 (August))** |
| decisions | `--decisions`, `-d` | type of academic decision **(default: None)**| 

For example, to generate a timeline using admission results associated with "math" starting from 2015 till now, looking at only Accepted and Rejected results dated between January and March, use the command

``
$ python main.py "math" -y 2015 -s 1 -e 3 -d "Accepted Rejected"
``

The plot would look like the following:
